        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Quick, simple, and utterly delicious, this bucatini all'amatriciana recipe – like many other classic Italian pasta dishes – stands the test of time. The secret to success in this dish lies in its quality ingredients – the beautiful guanciale, Pecorino Romano and San Marzano tomatoes make all the difference.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100g of guanciale, or good quality pancetta, diced into 0.5cm cubes</li>
            <li>400g of San Marzano tomatoes, (1 tin)</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 red chilli, diced (optional)</li>
            <li>50ml of white wine</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>400g of bucatini pasta</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano, to grate on top</li>
            <li>basil leaves, torn</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin, slowly heat the diced guanciale with a tablespoon of olive oil over a medium-low heat. If using onions and chilli, add them to the pan to soften in the rendered fat, cooking them until soft but without colour</li>
            <li>Once the guanciale is lightly golden, add the white wine and reduce by three quarters</li>
            <li>Add the tin of tomatoes (if using whole tomatoes, roughly chop them first)</li>
            <li>Cook down on a low heat for 10–15 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Taste and add salt and a pinch of sugar if necessary</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of heavily salted boiling water for 8–10 minutes, or as per packet instructions</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is al dente, drain and add it to the sauce, tossing to make sure the pasta is evenly coated</li>
            <li>Serve straight away with plenty of grated Pecorino Romano and some torn basil leaves</li>
        </ol>
