        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Beef soup Kharcho is a traditional dish of the Republic of Georgia and is known well outside of Georgia itself. There is a good reason for that – the soup is exceptionally delicious and has a characteristic rich flavor thanks to the spice mix that goes in it. This soup is traditionally made of fatty cuts of beef – chuck or brisket. As a result, the soup is rich and comforting. To balance out the richness of the soup sour plum sauce called Tkemali is traditionally added, which can be substituted by tomato puree or red wine vinegar. For a cold, wintry day I can’t think of a much better dish than a bowl of this delicious soup.</p>
